brain-wide changes to reconfigure traffic: certain connections weaken, others strengthen.
Affects connection strength and rapid-fire profiles. Need variations on connection types.
Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.
Analogy: weather. Makes for fast reconfig.

clusters and hubs.

Plasticity: Connections become more or less numerous. connections strengthen when neurons fire together, and weaker when alone. Slow reconfigure.

Neurons repurpose themselves, can do different jobs.

Always on, always chatting to itself. Required continual inputs.

Complexity: can reconfigure into enormous number of different patterns. Reuses bits of old patterns. Trial and error to find useful patterns.

tuning and pruning: start with way too many connections, gradually remove ones that aren't used. Ones that are used get faster, and are included in more patterns.

Define initial connectome by ingesting drawing of clusters and hubs. Can output current state to updated image, animated showing activity.

Brain persisted to SSD.

What does "firing together" mean? At the same time? Physical proximity? Both?

Tentative connections (dendrite buds) appear, and if not used, vanish.

Senses: rare sounds are tuned out.

Brains require a complex social world, sensory integration, to develop.

What parameters to vary?
- cluster size
- hub density
- range of connection str
- rate of change of connection str
- Num different weather types
- rapid fire rate, duration.
