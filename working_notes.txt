=== NOTES AND INSIGHTS CAPTURED WHILE STUDYING ===
==================================================

Insight: A sapient mind requires a brain with a suitable connectome shape.
The initial connectome has a basic structure of connections that, while it doesn't support a mind yet, can do so eventually.
The initial wiring is random.
Changes happen according to external inputs, via certain rules, and over time result in a connectome with a sapient mind.
For software to emulate a mind, the following are required:
1. Identify some candidate initial connectome structures. How many clusters, how connected, how many neurons, etc.
2. Set up external sensory stimulation (input), abstractly connected to some sort of motor output that influences the input, in a feedback loop.
3. Figure out the rules of plasticity, and apply them.
4. Run it over time, so it can re-wire usefully.

brain-wide changes to reconfigure traffic: certain connections weaken, others strengthen.
Affects connection strength and rapid-fire profiles. Need variations on connection types.
Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.
Analogy: weather. Makes for fast reconfig.

Overall structure: Clusters and hubs (airports analogy).

Plasticity: Connections become more or less numerous.
Connections strengthen when neurons fire together, and weaker when alone. Slow reconfigure.

Neurons repurpose themselves, can do different jobs.

Always on, always chatting to itself. Required continual inputs.

Complexity: can reconfigure into enormous number of different patterns. Reuses bits of old patterns.
Trial and error to find useful patterns.

Tuning and pruning: start with way too many connections, gradually remove ones that aren't used.
Ones that are used get faster, and are included in more patterns.

Maybe define initial connectome by ingesting drawing of clusters and hubs.
Can output current state to updated image, animated showing activity.

Tentative connections (dendrite buds) appear, and if not used, vanish.

Senses: rare sounds are tuned out.

Brains require a complex social world, sensory integration, to develop.

Add body state, including some sort of cycle, like day and night. Sleep?

Stages of development:
1. Superabundant initial connections
2. Sensory stimulation plus spontaneous firing, see which connections are useful, strengthen them, and remove the others
3. Remove entire neurons that lack sufficient connectivity

========================================
=== IDEAS ON SOME PARAMETERS TO VARY ===
========================================

- cluster size
- hub density
- range of connection str
- rate of change of connection str
- Num different weather types
- rapid fire rate, duration.

=== LIST OF THINGS TO DO ===
============================

(In progress): Define specification for connectome generation.

Figure out how to implement hubs. Clusters are easy, but what do hubs look like?

A significant unknown is currently how to preserve state of plasticity flux. We need a way to keep a history of trends.
I need to get my head around the details of the results of human neural plasticity operation
(the specifics of the mechanics that lead to these outcomes are not relevent).

Get a sense for number of neural firings that happen in a human brain per unit of time, per neuron.

Figure out specifically how "neurons that fire together wire together" works, and implement it.
If neuron A fires, and a short time later, neuron B fires, what would indicate that they are "together", and that they should both be strengthened?
Are we assuming that both A and B are connected to C?

Figure out how to persist state to SSD drives. How much space is needed? Can probably just directly use the file system.
Put files in directories. But the data won't all fit into memory, and each tick, all fired neurons will need to be accessed.
Maybe a local database makes more sense. Don't need RDBMS, mostly it would just be for looking up what neurons are connected to
each dendritic tree, and the connection strengths.

Would it work to specify initial connectome via an image? Black background.
White pixels in clumps representing clusters, lines between them representing hub connections?
Maybe not, just specify with a properties file instead.

Set up background chatter.

Thoughts on how to provide a rich social environment for training.
