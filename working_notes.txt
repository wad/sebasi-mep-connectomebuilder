=== NOTES CAPTURED WHILE STUDYING ===
=====================================

brain-wide changes to reconfigure traffic: certain connections weaken, others strengthen.
Affects connection strength and rapid-fire profiles. Need variations on connection types.
Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.
Analogy: weather. Makes for fast reconfig.

Overall structure: Clusters and hubs (airports analogy).

Plasticity: Connections become more or less numerous.
Connections strengthen when neurons fire together, and weaker when alone. Slow reconfigure.

Neurons repurpose themselves, can do different jobs.

Always on, always chatting to itself. Required continual inputs.

Complexity: can reconfigure into enormous number of different patterns. Reuses bits of old patterns.
Trial and error to find useful patterns.

Tuning and pruning: start with way too many connections, gradually remove ones that aren't used.
Ones that are used get faster, and are included in more patterns.

Maybe define initial connectome by ingesting drawing of clusters and hubs.
Can output current state to updated image, animated showing activity.

Tentative connections (dendrite buds) appear, and if not used, vanish.

Senses: rare sounds are tuned out.

Brains require a complex social world, sensory integration, to develop.

========================================
=== IDEAS ON SOME PARAMETERS TO VARY ===
========================================

- cluster size
- hub density
- range of connection str
- rate of change of connection str
- Num different weather types
- rapid fire rate, duration.

=== LIST OF THINGS TO DO ===
============================

Figure out how to implement hubs. Clusters are easy, but what do hubs look like?

Figure out specifically how "neurons that fire together wire together" works, and implement it.
If neuron A fires, and a short time later, neuron B fires, what would indicate that they are "together", and that they should both be strengthened?
Are we assuming that both A and B are connected to C?

Figure out how to persist state to SSD drives. How much space is needed? Can probably just directly use the file system.
Put files in directories. But the data won't all fit into memory, and each tick, all fired neurons will need to be accessed.
Maybe a local database makes more sense. Don't need RDBMS, mostly it would just be for looking up what neurons are connected to
each dendritic tree, and the connection strengths.

Would it work to specify initial connectome via an image? Black background.
White pixels in clumps representing clusters, lines between them representing hub connections?
Maybe not, just specify with a properties file instead.

Set up background chatter.

Thoughts on how to provide a rich social environment for training.
